## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)? 
  Due to this being the first time we worked together, we did not know enough about each other's skills, knowledge and work style and approach. This caused significant delay in assigning the right tasks to the right people, and also some missed opportunities where we could have shared knowledge about certain technologies.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  First of all to not underestimate the work load, and especially the time it takes to write complete tests for every story. Additionally, we have tried a few technologies, and we had the chance to understand their pros and cons, and to see if we want to keep them for the next project. We have learnt to work together, towards the end, and we will be able to organize ourselves better for the next project.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  (This being the first retrospective, we didn't have any official goals)
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
N/A
- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  > Propose one or two
  - Organize ourselves in such a way that different people can work independently and in parallel without any issues, this including the technical aspect (branches, conflicts etc)
  - Be able to finish the stories that we commit to, by choosing fewer ones and improve our estimation (thanks to the work we did for the previous sprint).
  - Better testing, including learning new technologies (for example, cypress for e2e testing) but also more coverage.
- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  We think we have a great team, we were able to all work together when it was needed, to progress further. Additionally, our skills and experiences are quite diverse, so we are able to cover a wider range of knowledge, including technologies but also best practices.
